Getting Started with Pepper Development
=======================================

It is highly recommended that you make use of a `virtual environment
<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`__ when you work on developing Pepper.
This will isolate any third-party dependencies from the rest of our system, and will allow you to
install development versions of Pepper without conflicting with a system version.
